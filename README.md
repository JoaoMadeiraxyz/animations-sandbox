# Animations Sandbox
Random animation related stuff.

## Overview
This is the repository that I use to store some of my codes related to animation that is not necessarily related to a project. Most of the stuff in here is for study purposes and may be broken, incomplete, with conflicts, slow, and other issues.

## Notes
I do not pretend do make a documentation for my experiments, but some times I will be adding notes here.

### Sticky
Sticky is a page with an experiment I have done, my goal here was to try to implement a cool effect using only CSS's sticky property.
- **Inspiration:**
I used the GUCCI home page as inspiration for the experiment, I wanted it to be fashion.
- **How It Was?**
It was an cool experiment, and I do pretend to use this technique in future projects, it turned out just like how I imagined.
- **What would I change for it to be better?**
Looking back, I do feel that the page is lacking some smooth scroll together with some scroll-snap
